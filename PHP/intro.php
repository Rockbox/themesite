<h1>Rockbox Themes</h1>

<p>Welcome to the official Rockbox Themes repository - a collection
  of themes designed and created by the Rockbox community, a testament to the
  creativity of many of the people who have visited and participated in the
  Rockbox site. This is the result of their desire to make their player look
  the way they want it to, and to share that vision with others. </p>
<p>Please note
  that some of these themes may require custom builds which are <b>not
  supported</b> by the Rockbox team or the themes may be out of date and may
  not appear as intended. </p>

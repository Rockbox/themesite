== INSTALLATION ==

1. Put the dir "public" somewhere where your webserver can see it. If you're
   running the site, making it the document root is expected.
2. Edit public/preconfig.inc.php to point to the location of
   private/config.inc.php. This directory should absolutely NOT be reachable
   through the webserver.
3. Edit private/config.inc.php and fix all the paths/settings.
4. The following dirs/files need to be writable by the webserver user:
    - private/themes.db
    - private/templates/cache
    - private/templates/compiled
    - public/themes
5. Compile checkwps for all targets and put them in private/checkwps/release
   and private/checkwps/current. Put their versions in a file named VERSION
   in each dir. See private/checkwps/current/update.sh for an easy way to do
   this.
6. Add some admin users using private/adduser.sh. This is done through the
   console to create an implicit "superadmin".

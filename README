== REQUIREMENTS ==

1. Apache with PHP5
2. Smarty (http://smarty.net/ or the 'smarty' package on Debian systems)
3. magic_quotes_gpc = Off in your apache config (or .htaccess)

== INSTALLATION ==

1. Put the dir "www" somewhere where your webserver can see it. If you're
   running the main site, making it the document root is expected.
2. Edit www/preconfig.inc.php to point to the location of
   private/config.inc.php. This directory should absolutely NOT be reachable
   through the webserver.
3. Edit private/config.inc.php and fix all the paths/settings.
4. The following dirs/files need to be writable by the webserver user:
    - private/themes.db
    - private/templates/cache
    - private/templates/compiled
    - www/themes
    - private/themes
5. Compile checkwps for all targets and put them in private/checkwps/release
   and private/checkwps/current. Put their versions in a file named VERSION
   in each dir. See private/checkwps/current/update.sh for an easy way to do
   this.
6. Add some admin users using private/adduser.sh. This is done through the
   console to create an implicit "superadmin".
7. (optional) When everything is up and running, add one index to the checkwps
   table:
   Run "sqlite private/themes.db" and execute the following SQL:
   CREATE INDEX checkwps_themeid ON checkwps(themeid);

== ONGOING STUFF ==

 1. Add commit hook or cron to execute checkwps/update.sh
    (do on every commmit?)
 2. Admin interface is busted with respect to multiple versions
    of a single theme.
 3. Appears to be no way to actually _delete_ a theme from disk
